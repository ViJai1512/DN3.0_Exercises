Big O Notation:

Definition: Big O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's running time, helping to classify algorithms by how they respond to changes in input size.

Purpose: It helps in analyzing the efficiency and scalability of algorithms by providing a high-level understanding of their performance.

Best, Average, and Worst-Case Scenarios for Search Operations:

Linear Search:

Best Case: 
O(1) - The target element is at the beginning of the list.
Average Case: 
O(n) - The target element is somewhere in the middle or at an unpredictable location.
Worst Case: 
O(n) - The target element is at the end of the list or not present at all.

Binary Search:

Best Case: 
O(1) - The target element is at the middle of the sorted list.
Average Case: 
O(logn) - The list is divided repeatedly to find the target element.
Worst Case: 
O(logn) - The element is at one of the ends of the sorted list or not present at all.
