Exercise 1: Inventory Management System

Why Data Structures and Algorithms are Essential in Handling Large Inventories:

Efficient Data Storage: Proper data structures ensure that products are stored in a way that optimizes space and allows for quick access.

Fast Retrieval: Efficient algorithms ensure that products can be retrieved quickly, which is crucial for managing inventory levels and processing orders.

Scalability: As the inventory grows, the system must handle increased data efficiently. Suitable data structures and algorithms allow the system to scale without performance degradation.

Data Integrity: Properly designed data structures help maintain the integrity and consistency of the inventory data.

Suitable Data Structures for Inventory Management:

ArrayList: Provides fast access to elements by index and is easy to use, but operations like adding and removing elements can be slow if they require shifting elements.

HashMap: Offers average-case constant time complexity for add, update, and delete operations. It's highly efficient for key-value pair storage and retrieval.
